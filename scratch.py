# the lower-level modules and clusters into increasingly complex representations. The network could also be designed to
# have multiple time scales of activity, such that slower dynamics at higher levels of the hierarchy could modulate the
# faster dynamics at lower levels.

# Additionally, the network could be designed to dynamically reconfigure itself in response to changes in the input data
# distribution, such as by forming and dissolving clusters or by adjusting the strength of connections between modules.
# This would allow the network to adapt to changes in the environment and maintain its non-equilibrium steady state.

# learning rate adapt_lr times the outer product of the difference vector with itself. The new strengths of connections
# cause the module outputs to shift towards a non-equilibrium steady state that is better suited to the current input
# distribution. The adapt method saves the current mean module outputs for use in the next iteration.
